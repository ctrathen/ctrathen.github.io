    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <p>I find <strong>snowboarding</strong> extremely interesting.
    I wish that I lived closer to the snow so that I could go more. I feel
    like if I had more time to practice that I could be better! My goal is to
    one day be able to go off <strong>huge jumps</strong> with perfect control.
